## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Business Logic

### Database Schema & Relationships
See comprehensive documentation: **[Database Schema](docs/database/database_diagram.md)**

**Core Tables:**
- **Users & Roles**: `user`, `role`, `user_roles`, `role_permissions`, `permission`
- **Products**: `product` (with stock management and availability)
- **Deals**: `deal_type`, `deal` (with expiration and strategy pattern)
- **Shopping**: `basket`, `basket_item` (with status management)
- **Orders**: `order_table`, `order_item` (with discount tracking)

### Security Architecture
- **JWT-based Stateless Authentication** - Scalable token-based security
- **Role-based Method-level Security** - Granular permission control
- **BCrypt Password Encryption** - Industry-standard password security
- **CORS Support** - Cross-origin resource sharing for frontend integration

### Discount Engine Architecture
**Strategy Pattern Implementation** with three distinct strategies:

1. **Percentage Discount Strategy**
   - Configurable percentage (0.01% to 100%)
   - Minimum quantity requirements
   - HALF_UP rounding for precise calculations

2. **Fixed Amount Discount Strategy**
   - Dollar amount discounts with safety caps
   - Cannot exceed total item price
   - Immediate savings visibility

3. **Buy One Get 50% Off Strategy**
   - Sophisticated bulk purchase incentives
   - Configurable discount percentages and minimum quantities
   - Integer division logic: `discounted_items = total_quantity / minimum_quantity`

**Multi-Deal Support:**
- Customers benefit from multiple deals simultaneously
- Discounts are additive (sum of all applicable discounts)
- Automatic expiration handling
- Real-time calculation during basket operations

### Business Logic Documentation
- **[Admin Business Logic](docs/business/admin.md)** - Product management, deal creation, discount strategies
- **[Customer Business Logic](docs/business/customer.md)** - Shopping experience, basket management, checkout process

## üêõ Error Handling & Validation

### Comprehensive Exception Management
- **`ProductNotFoundException`** - 404 Not Found with product ID details
- **`InsufficientStockException`** - 400 Bad Request with available quantity info
- **`BasketNotFoundException`** - 404 Not Found for invalid basket access
- **`DuplicateDealException`** - 400 Bad Request for duplicate deal creation
- **Validation Errors** - 400 Bad Request with detailed field validation messages
- **Authentication Errors** - 401 Unauthorized for invalid credentials
- **Authorization Errors** - 403 Forbidden for insufficient permissions

### Business Rule Enforcement
- **Product Validation**: Name uniqueness, positive pricing, stock management
- **Deal Validation**: Future expiration dates, valid discount ranges, minimum quantities
- **Basket Validation**: Stock availability, quantity limits, user ownership
- **Order Validation**: Complete basket verification, payment processing
